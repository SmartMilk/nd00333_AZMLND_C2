# Udacity Nanodegree Machine Learning Engineer - Project 2 (Operationalizing Machine Learning)

This project involves the incorporation of an AutoML-generated model into a showcase of the consumption and benchmarking of ML models using Azure, Swagger and Apache functionality. Additionally, I showcase how ML Pipelines in Azure can be created and consumed. Both elements feed into the core design of Machine Learning Operations: Trained ML models are matured to the point where they can be consumed and monitored by other users with their own data, while the pipelines showcase automated steps in ML processes that can for example be shared among a team of data scientists to optimize ML processes. 

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step.

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screencasts required to demonstrate key steps. 

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.
